## <H2>Heads Up</H2>
<br>If you have rewritten the partition table of a disk with an existing partition table (through the installer i.e.) and find mismatched partition information (after disk  partitioning i.e. The installer's showing whatever output's produced by the commands used in this script), don't worry about it and continue reformatting the disk & your partition information will be set right. If you still want to reconfirm if my installer's buggy then please manually wipe the disk (unmount first) using "wipefs -a /dev/\<disk\>" the disk you want to wipe, partition the disk with few partitions of the same sizes and partition order as before the wipe, lsblk the disk you wiped and partitioned and compare.<br><br>

Just Run the script and go through the options. Also, when inserting a new disk you don't need to exit the script to let your newly inserted disk to show up in the disk menu. Just wait for a second or two and select re-enter the "Partition Disk\*\*" menu.<br><br><br>
Plz Don't judge me for my horrible and confusing variable names and naming convention if you plan on reading the script ðŸ‘€. It's something I came up with on the spot and only had a vague idea on how the script should behave.<br><br><br>
